= Standard headers

This section describes a handful of standard headers, which we found raising the most
questions in our daily usage, or which are useful in particular circumstances
but not widely known.


[#133]
== {MAY} use standardized headers

Use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields[this list] and
explicitly mention its support in your OpenAPI definition.


[#132]
== {SHOULD} use uppercase separate words with hyphens for HTTP headers

This convention is followed by most standard headers e.g. as defined in 
{RFC-2616}[RFC 2616] and {RFC-4229}[RFC 4229]. Examples:

[source,http]
----
If-Modified-Since
Accept-Encoding
Content-ID
Language
----

Note, HTTP standard defines headers as case-insensitive ({RFC-7230}#page-22[RFC 7230, p.22]). 
However, for sake of readability and consistency you should follow the convention when 
using standard or proprietary headers. Exceptions are common abbreviations like `ID`. 


[#178]
== {MUST} use `Content-*` headers correctly

Content or entity headers are headers with a `Content-` prefix. They describe
the content of the body of the message and they can be used in both, HTTP
requests and responses. Commonly used content headers include but are not
limited to:

* {Content-Disposition} can indicate that the representation is supposed to be
  saved as a file, and the proposed file name.
* {Content-Encoding} indicates compression or encryption algorithms applied to
  the content.
* {Content-Length} indicates the length of the content (in bytes).
* {Content-Language} indicates that the body is meant for people literate in
  some human language(s).
* {Content-Location} indicates where the body can be found otherwise (<<179>>
  for more details]).
* {Content-Range} is used in responses to range requests to indicate which part
  of the requested resource representation is delivered with the body.
* {Content-Type} indicates the media type of the body content.


[#180]
== {SHOULD} use `Location` header instead of `Content-Location` header

As the correct usage of {Content-Location} response header (see below) with respect 
to caching and its method specific semantics is difficult, we _discourage_ the use 
of {Content-Location}. 
In most cases it is sufficient to inform clients about the resource location 
in create or re-direct responses by using the {Location} header while avoiding  
the {Content-Location} specific ambiguities and complexities.

More details in RFC 7231 {RFC-7231}#section-7.1.2[7.1.2 Location],
{RFC-7231}#section-3.1.4.2[3.1.4.2 Content-Location]


[#179]
== {MAY} use `Content-Location` header

The {Content-Location} header is _optional_ and can be used in successful write
operations ({PUT}, {POST}, or {PATCH}) or read operations ({GET}, {HEAD}) to
guide caching and signal a receiver the actual location of the resource
transmitted in the response body. This allows clients to identify the resource
and to update their local copy when receiving a response with this header.

The Content-Location header can be used to support the following use cases:

* For reading operations {GET} and {HEAD}, a different location than the
  requested URI can be used to indicate that the returned resource is subject
  to content negotiations, and that the value provides a more specific
  identifier of the resource.
* For writing operations {PUT} and {PATCH}, an identical location to the
  requested URI can be used to explicitly indicate that the returned resource
  is the current representation of the newly created or updated resource.
* For writing operations {POST} and {DELETE}, a content location can be used to
  indicate that the body contains a status report resource in response to the
  requested action, which is available at provided location.

*Note*: When using the {Content-Location} header, the {Content-Type} header
has to be set as well. For example:

[source,http]
----
GET /products/123/images HTTP/1.1

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: image/png
Content-Location: /products/123/images?format=raw
----


[#181]
== {MAY} consider to support `Prefer` header to handle processing preferences

The {Prefer} header defined in {RFC-7240}[RFC 7240] allows clients to request
processing behaviors from servers. It pre-defines a number of preferences and
is extensible, to allow others to be defined. Support for the {Prefer} header
is entirely optional and at the discretion of API designers, but as an existing
Internet Standard, is recommended over defining proprietary "X-" headers for
processing directives.

The {Prefer} header can defined like this in an API definition:

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  headers:
  - Prefer:
      description: >
        The RFC7240 Prefer header indicates that a particular server behavior
        is preferred by the client but is not required for successful completion
        of the request (see [RFC 7240](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240).
        The following behaviors are supported by this API:

        # (indicate the preferences supported by the API or API endpoint)
        * **respond-async** is used to suggest the server to respond as fast as
          possible asynchronously using 202 - accepted - instead of waiting for
          the result.
        * **return=<minimal|representation>** is used to suggest the server to
          return using 204 without resource (minimal) or using 200 or 201 with
          resource (representation) in the response body on success.
        * **wait=<delta-seconds>** is used to suggest a maximum time the server
          has time to process the request synchronously.
        * **handling=<strict|lenient>** is used to suggest the server to be
          strict and report error conditions or lenient, i.e. robust and try to
          continue, if possible.

      type: array
      items:
        type: string
      required: false
----

*Note:* Please copy only the behaviors into your {Prefer} header specification
that are supported by your API endpoint. If necessary, specify different
{Prefer} headers for each supported use case.

Supporting APIs may return the {Preference-Applied} header also defined in
{RFC-7240}[RFC 7240] to indicate whether a preference has been applied.


[#182]
== {MAY} consider to support `ETag` together with `If-Match`/`If-None-Match` header

When creating or updating resources it may be necessary to expose conflicts
and to prevent the 'lost update' or 'initially created' problem. Following
{RFC-7232}[RFC 7232 "HTTP: Conditional Requests"] this can be best accomplished
by supporting the {ETag} header together with the {If-Match} or {If-None-Match}
conditional header. The contents of an `ETag: <entity-tag>` header is either
(a) a hash of the response body, (b) a hash of the last modified field of the
entity, or (c) a version number or identifier of the entity version.

To expose conflicts between concurrent update operations via {PUT}, {POST}, or
{PATCH}, the `If-Match: <entity-tag>` header can be used to force the server to
check whether the version of the updated entity is conforming to the requested
{entity-tag}. If no matching entity is found, the operation is supposed a to
respond with status code {412} - precondition failed.

Beside other use cases, `If-None-Match: *` can be used in a similar way to
expose conflicts in resource creation. If any matching entity is found, the
operation is supposed a to respond with status code {412} - precondition
failed.

The {ETag}, {If-Match}, and {If-None-Match} headers can be defined as follows
in the API definition:

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  headers:
  - ETag:
      description: |
        The RFC 7232 ETag header field in a response provides the entity-tag of
        a selected resource. The entity-tag is an opaque identifier for versions
        and representations of the same resource over time, regardless whether
        multiple versions are valid at the same time. An entity-tag consists of
        an opaque quoted string, possibly prefixed by a weakness indicator (see
        [RFC 7232 Section 2.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-2.3).

      type: string
      required: false
      example: W/"xy", "5", "5db68c06-1a68-11e9-8341-68f728c1ba70"
    
  - If-Match:
      description: |
        The RFC7232 If-Match header field in a request requires the server to
        only operate on the resource that matches at least one of the provided
        entity-tags. This allows clients express a precondition that prevent
        the method from being applied if there have been any changes to the
        resource (see [RFC 7232 Section
        3.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-3.1).

      type: string
      required: false
      example: "5", "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70"
    
  - If-None-Match:
      description: |
        The RFC7232 If-None-Match header field in a request requires the server
        to only operate on the resource if it does not match any of the provided
        entity-tags. If the provided entity-tag is `*`, it is required that the
        resource does not exist at all (see [RFC 7232 Section
        3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-3.2).
    
      type: string
      required: false
      example: "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70", *

Please see <<optimistic-locking>> for a detailed discussion and options.


[#230]
== {MAY} consider to support `Idempotency-Key` header

When creating or updating resources it can be helpful or necessary to ensure a
strong <<idempotent>> behavior comprising same responses, to prevent duplicate
execution in case of retries after timeout and network outages. Generally, this
can be achieved by sending a client specific _unique request key_ – that is not
part of the resource – via {Idempotency-Key} header.

The _unique request key_ is stored temporarily, e.g. for 24 hours, together
with the response and the request hash (optionally) of the first request in a
key cache, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. The service can now
look up the _unique request key_ in the key cache and serve the response from
the key cache, instead of re-executing the request, to ensure <<idempotent>>
behavior. Optionally, it can check the request hash for consistency before
serving the response. If the key is not in the key store, the request is
executed as usual and the response is stored in the key cache.

This allows clients to safely retry requests after timeouts, network outages,
etc. while receive the same response multiple times. *Note:* The request retry
in this context requires to send the exact same request, i.e. updates of the
request that would change the result are off-limits. The request hash in the
key cache can protection against this misbehavior. The service is recommended
to reject such a request using status code {400}.

*Important:* To grant a reliable <<idempotent>> execution semantic, the
resource and the key cache have to be updated with hard transaction semantics
– considering all potential pitfalls of failures, timeouts, and concurrent
requests in a distributed systems. This makes a correct implementation
exceeding the local context very hard.

The {Idempotency-Key} header must be defined as follows, but you are free to
choose your expiration time:

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  headers:
  - Idempotency-Key:
      description: |
        The idempotency key is a free identifier created by the client to
        identify a request. It is used by the service to identify subsequent
        retries of the same request and ensure idempotent behavior by sending
        the same response without executing the request a second time.

        Clients should be careful as any subsequent requests with the same key
        may return the same response without further check. Therefore, it is
        recommended to use an UUID version 4 (random) or any other random
        string with enough entropy to avoid collisions.

        Idempotency keys expire after 24 hours. Clients are responsible to stay
        within this limits, if they require idempotent behavior.

      type: string
      format: uuid
      required: false
      example: "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70"
----

*Hint:* The key cache is not intended as request log, and therefore should
have a limited lifetime, else it could easily exceed the data resource in
size.

*Note:* The {Idempotency-Key} header unlike other headers in this section
is not standardized in an RFC. Our only reference are the usage in the
https://stripe.com/docs/api/idempotent_requests[Stripe API]. However, as it
fit not into our section about <<proprietary-headers>>, and we did not want
to change the header name and semantic, we decided to treat it as any other
common header.
